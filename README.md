## About The Project

**SHI4GUD** is a multichain DeFi platform featuring a Burn Bank mechanism that combines staking with charitable donations and token burning. The core principle is simple: stake your tokens to become part of the ecosystem, then donate ETH to automatically burn tokens from the staking pool. This process creates deflationary pressure on the staked token while supporting good causes and rewarding a lucky staker from the pool.

The dApp integrates directly with the Charity Burn Mechanism (CBM) technology developed by the [Shina Inu (SHI)](https://shinatoken.com) team. It is built with a modern tech stack including Vite, React, TypeScript, and wagmi for a fast and secure user experience.

### Key Features

*   ‚úÖ **Flexible & Multichain**: The architecture supports staking for any ERC-20 token on any EVM-compatible blockchain.
*   üî• **Token Burning**: Donations trigger automatic burning of tokens from the staking pool.
*   üíñ **Charitable Donations**: A portion of every donation is routed to a registered charity through an [Endaoment Fund](https://app.endaoment.org/gud).
*   üéÅ **Lottery Rewards**: Win a share of donations in a lottery-like drawing just by staking.
*   üìà **On-Chain Price Oracles**: The burn mechanism relies on Uniswap V2/V3 pools directly for real-time, on-chain pricing.
*   ‚öñÔ∏è **Weighted, Verifiable Rewards**: Stakers are chosen for rewards based on their minimum stake held throughout an entire epoch, with randomness sourced from future block hashes.
*   ü§ù **Decentralized Voting**: A network of off-chain nodes executes the reward selection and votes on-chain to achieve consensus.

### Built With

This project leverages the power of modern web and blockchain development tools.

*   **Frontend Framework**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (v6+), [React](https://react.dev/) (v19+)
*   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (v5.8+)
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (v4+)
*   **Web3 Integration**: [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) (v2.14+), [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) (v2.2+), [viem](https://viem.sh/) (v2.27+)
*   **State Management**: [TanStack React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (v5.75+)
*   **Routing**: [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/) (v7.6+)
*   **UI Components**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) (v0.508+), [React Select](https://react-select.com/) (v5.10+)
*   **Development Tools**: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (v9+), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

### Architecture Overview
The SHI4GUD dApp is a modern web application built on a robust and transparent stack. Here's a high-level look at its components:

*   **Frontend**: The user interface is built with React and powered by Vite for a fast, modern development experience. The source code for the dApp is available in this repository: [`SHI4GUD/shi4gud-dapp`](https://github.com/SHI4GUD/shi4gud-dapp).
*   **Blockchain Interaction**: We use wagmi and viem to handle blockchain interactions. Wallet connections are managed by RainbowKit.
*   **Smart Contracts**: The application's core logic is decentralized in a suite of smart contracts. The source code is available at [`shi4gud/shi4gud-contracts`](https://github.com/shi4gud/shi4gud-contracts), and you can find detailed documentation for each contract in the ["Contract & Oracles"](https://docs.shi4gud.com/smart-contracts/ktv2factory-contract) section of the docs.
*   **Off-Chain Services**: A network of off-chain nodes executes the reward selection and votes on-chain to achieve consensus. The source code for the node is available at [`shi4gud/shi4gud-node`](https://github.com/shi4gud/shi4gud-node), and you can find detailed documentation in the ["Off-Chain Nodes"](https://docs.shi4gud.com/node/ktoc) section of the docs.

### SHI4GUD Telegram Bot

The SHI4GUD Telegram Bot allows anyone to monitor a Burn Bank smart contract directly within their Telegram group. It provides real-time notifications for key events, helping communities stay up-to-date with a project's Burn Bank activity.

The official bot can be found on Telegram at [@Shi4gudBot](https://t.me/Shi4gudBot). For more details on its features and commands, please refer to the [**Telegram Bot documentation**](https://docs.shi4gud.com/telegram-bot).
